WARNING — PROTECTED CORE
Webkernel™ is the intellectual property of Numerimondes.

This directory contains the governed Core. The embedded serial is an
instance identity marker (Version, Release Year, Unique Suffix).
It allows the central server to recognize your instance and decide
module delivery.

INTEGRITY NOTICE:
Only unmodified cores are eligible for:
- Official updates and security patches
- Marketplace module delivery
- Enterprise support and certifications

Any alteration, fork, or manual patch:
1. Voids all functional guarantees.
2. Terminates access to update channels and modules.
3. Risks systemic regressions and security vulnerabilities.

Numerimondes is the sole authority for Webkernel™ evolution. Modified
versions are unsupported, untrusted, and must not present themselves
as official Webkernel™ distributions.

DO NOT MODIFY THIS CORE UNLESS YOU FULLY ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES.
