WEBKERNEL COMMERCIAL LICENSE — OVERVIEW

Webkernel™ is the property of Numerimondes. This commercial license is a
proprietary agreement designed for organizations requiring professional
stability, official certification, and direct ecosystem access.

1. ENTERPRISE READINESS & WARRANTY

   Unlike the standard FOSS license provided "as-is," the Commercial License
   guarantees the integrity of the source code. It includes professional
   indemnity and a commitment to stability, ensuring that your core infrastructure
   remains robust under enterprise-level loads.

2. CERTIFICATION & TRUST

   By acquiring a commercial license, your deployment is officially "Certified
   by Numerimondes." This status is essential for projects involving
   governmental entities or large corporations that require verified,
   unmodified, and officially supported software stacks for security audits.

3. ADVANCED MODULE DELIVERY

   A commercial license whitelists your instance's unique serial on the
   Webkernel Master Server. This unlocks professional-tier modules and
   services not available in the public repository:
   * High-scale multitenancy and brand isolation logic.
   * Advanced security auditing and compliance tools.
   * Native enterprise integrations and priority updates.


4. PARTNERSHIP & SUPPORT

   License holders gain a direct channel for technical support and core
   architectural guidance. This ensures that your internal teams or the
   agencies building upon your Webkernel instance have direct access to
   official maintenance and security patches.

5. LICENSING AUTHORITY

   Numerimondes remains the sole authority for core evolution. The Master
   Server distinguishes between Enterprise and Governmental tiers to deliver
   specialized components tailored to specific jurisdictional requirements.
